3. Two more suggestions for the How to answer questions in a helpful way
	1. Some times writing the wrong answer confidently can make someone with the correct answer angry and make them fix it
	2. Guiding people/ working with them to find the solution usually makes everyone working on the answer a better programer

4. The first thing that I got out of the reading was to make sure that I do not piss off big organization that could sue me for wrong doing.
	Secondly is that you can be repremanded for the effects of software that you write. My meaning of this is that the effects or products of 
	software that I write can come back to me, despite me not being directly responsible for those productions. Something else to be warry of 
	is when dealing with something that delivers, or modifies other products to be careful not to distribute or handle these other products in 
	a way that can come back to me. So make sure to check rules of distribution for items and software that my software might interact with 
	and follow those rules.
